Since the code must be compatible for two platforms, two '.mk' files are created. 
One is 'sources_HOST.mk' which includes files compatible to the host system only.
Other is 'sources_HOST.mk' which includes all files compatible to MSP432.
The 'makefile' has been made generic which can accept both '.mk' files depending upon the platform.

The commands to build for host system are:
make PLATFORM=HOST
make all PLATFORM=HOST
make build PLATFORM=HOST
make compile-all PLATFORM=HOST
make clean PLATFORM=HOST

The commands to build for MSP432 are:
make PLATFORM=MSP432
make all PLATFORM=MSP432
make build PLATFORM=MSP432
make compile-all PLATFORM=MSP432
make clean PLATFORM=MSP432
